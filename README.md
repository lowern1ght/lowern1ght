I like 3d modeling out of a hobby, 
I could have left a link to <code>sketchfab</code>,
but my account was blocked due to the political situation 
<strike>(because I am of Russian nationality)</strike>. 
There is a video on my YouTube 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3lD0dc9YRnF5z4bUbE-FpA">Channel</a>.

I love writing code, I've had a passion for it since I was 14.
While everyone was walking and enjoying, I was learning the basics of the IT world.
I started with a simple layout before sites on react.
I wrote bots, parsers for sites on selenium, 
mini-applications in c++ for <code>unix</code> and <code>windows</code> machines,
worked with postgresql, administered, configured on the first job. 
Currently active work with <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>ASP .NET Core</strong>
